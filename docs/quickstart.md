# Quickstart

Install W&B and start tracking your machine learning experiments in minutes.

## 1. Create an account and install W&B
Before you get started, make sure you create an account and install W&B:

1. [Sign up](https://wandb.ai/site) for a free account at [https://wandb.ai/site](https://wandb.ai/site) and then login to your wandb account.  
2. Install the wandb library on your machine in a Python 3 environment using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/wandb/).  
<!-- 3. Login to the wandb library on your machine. You will find your API key here: [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize).   -->

The following code snippets demonstrate how to install and log into W&B using the W&B CLI and Python Library:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="notebook"
  values={[
    {label: 'Notebook', value: 'notebook'},
    {label: 'Command Line', value: 'cli'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

Install the CLI and Python library for interacting with the Weights and Biases API:

```
pip install wandb
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="notebook">

Install the CLI and Python library for interacting with the Weights and Biases API:

```python
!pip install wandb
```


  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Log in to W&B


<Tabs
  defaultValue="notebook"
  values={[
    {label: 'Notebook', value: 'notebook'},
    {label: 'Command Line', value: 'cli'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

Next, log in to W&B:

```
wandb login
```

Or if you are using [W&B Server:](./guides/hosting)

```
wandb login --host=http://wandb.your-shared-local-host.com
```

Provide [your API key](https://wandb.ai/authorize) when prompted.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="notebook">

Next, import the W&B Python SDK and log in:

```python
wandb.login()
```

Provide [your API key](https://wandb.ai/authorize) when prompted.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## 3. Start a  run and track hyperparameters

Initialize a W&B Run object in your Python script or notebook with [`wandb.init()`](./ref/python/run.md) and pass a dictionary to the `config` parameter with key-value pairs of hyperparameter names and values:

```python
run = wandb.init(
    # Set the project where this run will be logged
    project="my-awesome-project",
    # Track hyperparameters and run metadata
    config={
        "learning_rate": 0.01,
        "epochs": 10,
    })
```


<!-- ```python
run = wandb.init(project="my-awesome-project")
``` -->

A [run](./guides/runs) is the basic building block of W&B. You will use them often to [track metrics](./guides/track), [create logs](./guides/artifacts), [create jobs](./guides/launch), and more.


<!-- ## Track metrics -->
<!-- Pass a dictionary to the `config` parameter with key-value pairs of hyperparameter name and values when you initialize a run object:

```python
  # Track hyperparameters and run metadata
  config={
      "learning_rate": lr,
      "epochs": epochs,
  }
``` -->


<!-- Use [`wandb.log()`](./ref/python/log.md) to track metrics:

```python
wandb.log({'accuracy': acc, 'loss': loss})
```

Anything you log with `wandb.log` is stored in the run object that was most recently initialized. -->



## Putting it all together

Putting it all together, your training script might look similar to the following code example. The highlighted code shows W&B-specific code. 
Note that we added code that mimics machine learning training.

```python
# train.py
import wandb
import random # for demo script

# highlight-next-line
wandb.login()

epochs=10
lr=0.01

# highlight-start
run = wandb.init(
    # Set the project where this run will be logged
    project="my-awesome-project",
    # Track hyperparameters and run metadata
    config={
        "learning_rate": lr,
        "epochs": epochs,
    })
# highlight-end    

offset = random.random() / 5
print(f"lr: {lr}")

# simulating a training run
for epoch in range(2, epochs):
    acc = 1 - 2 ** -epoch - random.random() / epoch - offset
    loss = 2 ** -epoch + random.random() / epoch + offset
    print(f"epoch={epoch}, accuracy={acc}, loss={loss}")
    # highlight-next-line
    wandb.log({"accuracy": acc, "loss": loss})

# run.log_code()
```

That's it! Navigate to the W&B App at [https://wandb.ai/home](https://wandb.ai/home) to view how the metrics we logged with W&B (accuracy and loss) improved during each training step.
